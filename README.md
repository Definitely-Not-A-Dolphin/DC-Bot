<p class="not">
  One day I woke up and had the urge to make a discord bot. I do not know
  where it came from, but here it is anyway! It can translate to morse code
  and send memes based on a number. I plan on making it run 24/7 once I get
  a raspberry pi!
</p>
<p class="nob not">
  Some things that I wish to include / add in the future are:
</p>
<ul class="nob not">
  <li>More memes, but I have to wait for a server first</li>
  <li>
    A way for trusted users (me, friends) to upload their memes via discord.
  </li>
</ul>
